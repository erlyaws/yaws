# Homebrew on OSX

If you develop on OSX (Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion), the yaws formula
has been fixed for Erlang R16B01 and above users. To install please run:
`brew install yaws`. To install the HEAD using Homebrew run:
`brew install --HEAD yaws`.

This was introduced with [this pull request merge](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/23076).
