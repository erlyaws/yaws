# Homebrew on OSX

If you develop on OS X (Mavericks, Mountain Lion, Lion, Snow Leopard), the
Yaws formula works correctly for users of Erlang/OTP R17 and above. To
install please run:

    brew install yaws

To install the HEAD using Homebrew run:

    brew install --HEAD yaws

This capability was made to work correctly with [this pull request
merge](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/23076).
