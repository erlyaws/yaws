# Homebrew on OSX

If you develols .gip on OS X, the Yaws formula works correctly for users of
Erlang/OTP 24.2 and above. To install please run:

    brew install yaws

To install the HEAD using Homebrew run:

    brew install --HEAD yaws

This capability was made to work correctly with [this pull request
merge](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/23076).
