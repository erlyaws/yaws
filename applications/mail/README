This is a very basic WebMail application which is completely
stateless, by design. I didn't want any SQL databases etc
for storing the emails.

The reason for building it was that I needed a local WebMail
and I didn't want to install an Apache with python or PHP,
and besides all those relied on some local store (mbox, MySQL
etc) which I didn't want. Also, Klacke told me that he never
finished the other webmail app so I started from scratch.

A few important things are still missing. The most notable is the
ability to handle attached files and email on multipart format...


To install
----------

- Modify include.mk for your local paths

Run 'make' and 'make install'



- Edit/Create /etc/mail/yaws-webmail.conf

(Make install will create a good template for the conf
 file in /etc/mail)



Two things need to be edited in /etc/yaws.conf

1. yaws must find the beam code for mail.beam,
   By default (include.mk) that gets installed in
   /var/yaws/ebin

   This path must be added to /etc/yaws conf as in:

   ebin_dir = /var/yaws/ebin



2. The virtual server that is supposed to run the webmail
   must have an appmod called 'attachment' installed.

   Here is an example:

   <server flinta>
         port = 80
         appmods = attachment
         listen = 0.0.0.0
         docroot =  /var/yaws/mail
   </server>
