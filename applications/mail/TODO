Things to do

	- handle attachments in received emails
	- optionally include old text as quoted text in reply. We
	  need to select the text part for the quote if the email
	  is of type multipart/alternative. We select text/html
	  to display.
	- page large inboxes with 20 emails per page (sorted in 
	  reverse order with most recently received emails first)
	- write an attachement cache to limit the delays when 
	  fetching an attachement
	- code outgoing emails as quoted-printable (must limit max
	  line length to 74 according to RFC ???)

	- Sort by 'From', 'Subject' and 'Nr'
	- Implement mail forwarding
	- Support imap mail backend system.
	- Properly decode encoded attachments.
