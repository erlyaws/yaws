<p><em>Note:</em> An added Yapp will always be stored in the registry,
but if the application is not really in the load path of the Erlang system it will not
be loaded into Yaws server configuration. In such case it will not show up the when listing
the applications in the Yapp console, but it will show up in the Remove list.</p>
<p>If the yapp handler fails to find the application, a record will be written to the error log.
The application may be included in the load path later, and will be put into Yaws configuration
when Yaws is hupped or next time a Yapp is added/removed.</p>
