An easy way to deploy Yaws applications (Yapps) independently of
each other.

To compile : 
  make
Generate edoc documents : 
  make docs
Install:
  make install

You need to have compiled (configured) the Yaws application before
making yapp.
See the generated documents for more info in how to use the yapp 
application.
The current application uses mnesia so a precondition is that a
schema is generated for the node Yaws is running on.

Known problems
- You need a trailing "/" to your path when doing directory
  based access to the yapp.


TODO

- subscribe on mnesia events so that the yapp registry can be
  updated and used in a cluster of yaws nodes.

- Support to create .boot and relup scripts so that Yapps can be
  added/upgraded/downgraded/removed on a running Yaws server.

- Cluster support for the point above.
