<h2> The source for the shopping cart </h2>

<p class=pp>The shoppingcart contains a number of tricks and "preferred" ways to
 code different typical solutions to servers side state applications.

The source itself resides in the www/shoppingcart directory in the
source code tree. A <a href="shopcart.erl">link to the source itself</a> to view from
the browser.
</p>
<h3> The first trick, the <tt>break</tt> statement </h3>

<p class="pp">
The source of all yaws pages (including example index.yaws)
look very similar in this application, specifically</p>

<div style="background: rgb(211, 211, 211)">
<pre>
out(A) -&gt;
    case shopcart:top(A) of
        ok -&gt;
            shopcart:index(A);
        X -&gt;
            X
    end.

</pre>
</div>

<p class=pp>All code, including the head containing the link 
to the stylesheet is dynamically
generated. The first function in all code snippets in yaws files is always
a call to <tt>shopcart:top(A)</tt></p>
<p class=pp>The <tt>top/1</tt> function will check the cookie and if a cookie
which is associated to an active session is found, the request is granted, 
otherwise the login page is displayed by the <tt>shopcart:login(A)</tt> function.</p>
<p class=pp>The last item displayed by the login function is the atom <tt>break</tt>. When the
yaws server sees the <tt>break</tt>, it will not process any more data from the
yaws page being requested. Thus, we can have the login call at the top of a yaws
page and still have subsequent html/yaws code on the same page.</p>


<h3>Redirect to the requested page</h3>

<p class=pp>Since the <tt>login(A)</tt> function is supplied with the 
Arg of the requested page, the login function
will set the path of the requested page in a hidden field in the login form.
The code that processes the login form will then issue a redirect to the
value of this hidden field if the login in successful.</p>


<h3>Ehtml</h3>
<p class=pp>The use of the ehtml output syntax makes it more convenient to dynamically
generate structured content:</p>

<ul>
<li><p class=pp>
It is easier to get the structure right,</p></li>
<li><p class=pp>It 
is easier to inject the dynamically generated parts in the structure,</p></li>
<li><p class=pp>It is <em>much </em> more beautiful.</p></li>
</ul>
 
<p class=pp>See the <a href="shopcart.erl">source</a> for a number of "proofs" for this.</p>

<h3>The use of the <b>yaws_session_server</b> </h3>
<p class=pp>The yaws_session_server is designed to facilitate server side
state applications. The yaws application writer is supplied 
with the following capabilities and services:</p>

<ol>
<li><p class=pp>Truly random cookie generation. Each cookie can 
subsequently be used to uniquely identify a session.</p></li>

<li><p class=pp>Maintenance of an opaque application state in an ets table.
This state is readily available to the yaws page by means of the cookie.</p></li>

<li><p class=pp>Old idle sessions are garbage collected.</p></li>
</ol>
