<p>
The code to read the cookie, is simple, we get the cookie passed to the yaws
code in the #arg structure which is the argument supplied to the out/1 function.
 
<p>We use the <tt>yaws_api:find_cookie_val/2</tt> function to parse
the raw cookie string passed to us from the browser.

The code is:
<erl>
out(A) ->
    yaws_api:pre_ssi_files(A#arg.docroot, ["readcookie.yaws"]).
</erl>
