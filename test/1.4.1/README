ibrowse is a HTTP client. The following are a list of features.
	- RFC2616 compliant (AFAIK) 
	- supports GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, 
          MKCOL, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK, MOVE and COPY
	- Understands HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1
	- Understands chunked encoding
        - Can generate requests using Chunked Transfer-Encoding
	- Pools of connections to each webserver
	- Pipelining support
	- Download to file
	- Asynchronous requests. Responses are streamed to a process
	- Basic authentication
	- Supports proxy authentication
	- Can talk to Secure webservers using SSL
	- any other features in the code not listed here :)

ibrowse is available under two different licenses. LGPL and the BSD license.

CONTRIBUTIONS & CHANGE HISTORY
==============================
21-05-2008 - * Fixed bug in reading some options from the ibrowse.conf file.
               Reported by Erik Reitsma on the erlyaws mailing list
             * Fixed bug when cleaning up closing connections

27-03-2008 - * Major rewrite of the load balancing feature. Additional module,
               ibrowse_lb.erl, introduced to achieve this.
             * Can now get a handle to a connection process which is not part of
               the load balancing pool. Useful when an application is making
               requests to a webserver which are time consuming (such as 
               uploading a large file). Such requests can be put on a separate
               connection, and all other smaller/quicker requests can use the
               load balancing pool. See ibrowse:spawn_worker_process/2 and
               ibrowse:spawn_link_worker_process/2
             * Ram Krishnan sent a patch to enable a client to send a lot of
               data in a request by providing a fun which is invoked by the
               connection handling process. This fun can fetch the data from 
               any where. This is useful when trying to upload a large file
               to a webserver.
             * Use the TCP_NODELAY option on every socket by default
             * Rudimentary support for load testing of ibrowse. Undocumented, 
               but see ibrowse_test:load_test/3. Use the source, Luke!
             * New function ibrowse:show_dest_status/2 to view state of
               connections/pipelines to a web server

20-02-2008 - Ram Krishnan sent another patch for another hidden bug in the
             save_response_to_file feature.

07-02-2008 - Ram Krishnan (kriyative _at_ gmail dot com) sent a simple patch to
             enable specifying the filename in the save_response_to_file option.
             When testing the patch, I realised that my original implementation
             of this feature was quite flaky and a lot of corner cases were 
             not covered.  Fixed all of them. Thanks Ram!

17-10-2007 - Matthew Reilly (matthew dot reilly _at_ sipphone dot com) 
             sent a bug report and a fix. If the chunk trailer spans two TCP 
             packets, then ibrowse fails to recognise that the chunked transfer
	     has ended.

29-08-2007 - Bug report by Peter Kristensen(ptx _at_ daimi dot au dot dk). 
             ibrowse crashes when the webserver returns just the Status line 
             and nothing else.

28-06-2007 - Added host_header option to enable connection to secure sites
             via stunnel

20-04-2007 - Geoff Cant sent a patch to remove URL encoding for digits in
             ibrowse_lib:url_encode/1.
             ibrowse had a dependency on the inets application because the 
             ibrowse_http_client.erl invoked httpd_util:encode_base64/1. This
             dependency is now removed and the encode_base64/1 has been 
             implemented in ibrowse_lib.erl

06-03-2007 -  Eric Merritt sent a patch to support WebDAV requests.

12-01-2007 -  Derek Upham sent in a bug fix. The reset_state function was not
              behaving correctly when the transfer encoding was not chunked.

13-11-2006 -  Youns Hafri reported a bug where ibrowse was not returning the 
                temporary filename when the server was closing the connection 
                after sending the data (as in HTTP/1.0).
              Released ibrowse under the BSD license

12-10-2006 -  Chris Newcombe reported bug in dealing with requests where no 
              body is expected in the response. The first request would succeed
              and the next request would hang.

24-May-2006 - Sean Hinde reported a bug. Async responses with pipelining was 
              returning the wrong result.

08-Dec-2005 - Richard Cameron (camster@citeulike.org). Patch to ibrowse to
              prevent port number being included in the Host header when port
              80 is intended.

22-Nov-2005 - Added ability to generate requests using the Chunked 
              Transfer-Encoding.

08-May-2005 - Youns Hafri made a CRUX LINUX port of ibrowse.
	      http://yhafri.club.fr/crux/index.html

Here are some usage examples. Enjoy!
