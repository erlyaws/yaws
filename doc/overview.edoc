@title Yaws -An Erlang Web Server
@doc
<p>
This is a very rough import of Yaws into Erlware.
In particular <i>-disable-pam</i> was used to create
the configure script. It is uncertain what the effects
of this are. Also some modules was not included in the
yaws.app file and may therefore not be compiled.
</p>
<p>
They were: <code>ymnesia, yaws_showarg, yaws_vdir, yaws_content_negotiation</code>
It is unclear if they were intentionally left out or not.
</p>
<p>
Finally some files, that normally is generated at build time
was included <i>already generated</i>.
They were: <code>mime_types.erl, yaws_generated.erl</code>.
